```css
.example {
  display: block;
}
```

Element starts on a new line and takes full available width by default.

---

```css
.example {
  display: inline;
}
```

Element flows inline with text; `width` and `height` cannot be applied.

---

```css
.example {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 120px;
  height: 60px;
}
```

Element flows inline but allows setting `width` and `height` like a block.

---

```css
.example {
	display : flex;
	display : grid;
}
```
